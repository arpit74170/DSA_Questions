# Maximize Points After Choosing K Tasks

Can you solve this real interview question? Maximize Points After Choosing K Tasks - You are given two integer arrays, technique1 and technique2, each of length n, where n represents the number of tasks to complete.

 * If the ith task is completed using technique 1, you earn technique1[i] points.
 * If it is completed using technique 2, you earn technique2[i] points.

You are also given an integer k, representing the minimum number of tasks that must be completed using technique 1.

You must complete at least k tasks using technique 1 (they do not need to be the first k tasks).

The remaining tasks may be completed using either technique.

Return an integer denoting the maximum total points you can earn.

 

Example 1:

Input: technique1 = [5,2,10], technique2 = [10,3,8], k = 2

Output: 22

Explanation:

We must complete at least k = 2 tasks using technique1.

Choosing technique1[1] and technique1[2] (completed using technique 1), and technique2[0] (completed using technique 2), yields the maximum points: 2 + 10 + 10 = 22.

Example 2:

Input: technique1 = [10,20,30], technique2 = [5,15,25], k = 2

Output: 60

Explanation:

We must complete at least k = 2 tasks using technique1.

Choosing all tasks using technique 1 yields the maximum points: 10 + 20 + 30 = 60.

Example 3:

Input: technique1 = [1,2,3], technique2 = [4,5,6], k = 0

Output: 15

Explanation:

Since k = 0, we are not required to choose any task using technique1.

Choosing all tasks using technique 2 yields the maximum points: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15.
